# Animated Navbar
In this tutorial ([Open in Youtube](https://youtu.be/Dednh-JMr0Y)), I'm going to show you how to use modern HTML, CSS and JS to create a completely responsive Animated Navbar. We'll be using CSS Flexbox, Media queries for our responsive project, and CSS  transition for animating it.
